# Basic .NET template

This a basic (and opionated) template that I generally use to get new .NET projects off the ground.

## Features

- Centrally managed NuGet packages and .NET `TargetFramework`
- Enforce [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via Git Hook
- EditorConfig, which is also picked up by [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/)
