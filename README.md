# Basic .NET template

This a basic (and opionated) template that I generally use to get new .NET projects off the ground.

## Features

- Centrally managed NuGet packages and .NET `TargetFramework`
- Enforce [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via Git Hook
- Auto-formatting of common file types using [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
